                I am a passionate student at Griffith College Cork pursuing a
                degree in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science since 2023.
                Currently, I have started the 2 stage of this journey.

            <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                During the first stage, I had the opportunity to practice how
                important and challenging is to work with others people with
                different ideas. Which successfully led us to concluded one
                course
            </p>
            <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                Besides that, my interesting in Tech has started some years ago.
                It was when I took a course of Software Development in 2022
                offered by Senac Brazil and I realized that being a developer is
                the only thing that fills me completely. Since then, I have been
                studying everyday trying to improve my skills.
