            <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                I am a passionate student at Griffith College Cork pursuing a
                degree in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science since 2023.
                I am currently at the second year of this journey.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                During the first year, I had the opportunity to practice my social skills working as part of a group project. Although being challenging, I could see the importance and how it, successfully, led us to concluding one of the modules.

            <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                Besides that, my interest in Tech has started some years ago, when I took this Software Development course, in 2022, offered by Senac Brazil, and I realized that being a developer is the only thing that fills me completely. Since then, I have been studying every day to improve my skills.
